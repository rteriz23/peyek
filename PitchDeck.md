# P.E.Y.E.K Pitch Deck
**Platform Extensible Yielding Engineering Kit**
*Build Faster. Drag Smarter. Deploy Anywhere.*

---

## 🛑 1. The Problem
Developers and agencies spend **hundreds of hours** rebuilding the same generic features (Modals, Drag & Drop Builders, PDF Viewers) across different tech stacks (Laravel, CodeIgniter, Vue, React).

1. **Vendor Lock-in:** Tools are often locked to a specific framework (e.g., a Vue-only drag-and-drop builder).
2. **Legacy Bloat:** Adding modern UI features to legacy PHP apps usually requires rewriting the entire frontend or injecting heavy generic libraries like Bootstrap.
3. **High Development Costs:** Building custom SaaS interfaces from scratch drains budgets.

---

## 💡 2. The Solution
**P.E.Y.E.K** is a framework-agnostic, lightweight JavaScript SDK that injects powerful UI features into *any* web environment instantly.

### Core Value Propositions:
- **Universal Compatibility:** Works seamlessly with HTML, React, Laravel, Yii, and CodeIgniter.
- **Zero-Dependency Modals:** Beautiful, animated auto-modals generated on-the-fly.
- **Embeddable UI Builder:** Add drag-and-drop functionality to your own app in 3 lines of code.
- **Lightweight PDF Viewer:** Robust PDF rendering wrapper without dealing with web worker complexities.

## 📈 3. Market Size & Target Audience
**TAM (Total Addressable Market):** $15.4 Billion (Global Web Development & Web Builder Market).
**Target Audience:**
1. **Solo Developers & Freelancers:** Needing to deliver client projects faster.
2. **Web Agencies:** Looking for a unified toolset across varying client tech stacks to reduce overhead.
